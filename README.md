# Movie_DB Movie App

* NextJS
* @tanstack/react-query
* Typescript
* TailwindCSS

This app fetches data from The Movie Database API on the client side with react query and uses getStaticProps and getStaticPaths on the server side with NextJS.

Big thanks and credit to [ Thomas Weibenfalk](https://www.youtube.com/c/Weibenfalk) for this code and great tutorial, helping me get familiar with typescript and keeping me well practiced with react-query and NextJS.
